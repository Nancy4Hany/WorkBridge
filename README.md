WORKBREDGE is a hiring platform similar to LinkedIn that matches job seekers' profiles to recruiters and organizations. This project is developed by me and my team for a university project in the advanced SWE course.

## :arrow_down: Installation

We have Divided our project into two sub projects, one for the API and one for the FrontEnd part. 
### _setting up the frontend project_ <br>
### :hammer: _ReactJs settup_ 
:one: Make sure you have installed node js. If not, install it from here https://nodejs.org/en/download <br>
:two: type `cd WorkBridge-ui` and then Install npm by running the following command: `npm install` <br>
:three: run `npm install react-scripts` <br>
_if you want to run the ReactJs app, type `npm start` <br>


 ## :octocat: Git & GitHub 
### adding your work from the working branch area to the remote branch 
- `git checkout <your-branch-name>` <br> 
- Merge any changes from your working branch into the branch you want to push to using `git merge <working-branch>` <br> 
- if there are merge conflicts arised resolve them. <br>
- now you can push your work to the meant branch <br>
:one: `git add .`<br>
:two: `git commit -m "<your-message>"` make sure to copy the commit message structure from Jira <br>
:three: `git push` <br>


## :eyeglasses: Team Work 

### _conventions and Rules_  
#### _kindly read it carefully and apply each point in your tasks_
- build an organzied OCL document for your task before starting it 
- work only on your task files and folders and be organized ( don't touch other tasks and folders and avoid conflicts ) 
- use the correct naming conventions in your code 
- use Aspect Oriented programming as much as needed in your code 
- review your code after finishing it and check if it needs any kind of enhancements ( is the code clean ?, can it be more clean?, did i use naming conventions?....)
- build ReactJs components for your tasks and be aware of React naming conventions 

### _Jira collaboration_
- each sprint (meeting) we will be doing a peer review on each others code 
- each sprint (meeting) we will push our work to the meant branches and merging them with the main branch ( deliver the version ) 
- each sprint (meeting) we will be estimating the tasks duration, effort level by using the poker cards way <br>
..to be completed..
